# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## Definition

k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, that aims to partition data points / observations into distinct groups based on their similarity with each other. The number of distinct groups is determined by the value *k*. The similarity of each group is represented by means of the data points.

This method is part of the unsupervised learning where we need to find a meaningful insight to the unlabeled data. This method can be powerful for e.g. customer segmentation, where companies would like to get insights on customers shopping behaviour on their product.
